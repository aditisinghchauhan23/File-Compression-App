# File-Compression-App

This project is made using data structure and algorithms and the algo primarily involved in the presented is Huffman's Algorithm. Huffman Algorithm is a technique of compressing data to reduce its size without losing any of the details. This is one of the most basic representation of the Algorithm.

This project supports two functions:
1) Encode: Compresses input file.
2) Decode: Decompresses Huffman coded file is passed back to its original file.

Tech stack used: Trees, Huffman Algorithm, C++ programming language
